## Introduction 🚀
This repository demonstrates my journey as I complete various labs in AWS Skill Builder. Each lab is designed to cover specific AWS services, concepts, and real-world scenarios. The goal is to solidify my understanding of cloud computing and its applications through hands-on experience.
Key topics explored in these labs include (but are not limited to):
- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
- **Storage**: S3, EBS, Glacier
- **Networking**: VPC, Route 53, Load Balancers
- **Databases**: RDS, DynamoDB
- **Monitoring and Security**: CloudWatch, IAM, KMS
- **DevOps**: CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
- **Machine Learning**: Sagemaker
- **Big Data**: Athena, Redshift, and EMR


## Lab Structure 🗂️
Each lab in this repository will have its own dedicated section or directory, and the structure will typically look as follows:
``` 
📂 AWS-Skill-Builder-Labs
 ├── Lab-01_Name/
 │    ├── README.md        # Lab-specific instructions, objectives, and steps
 │    ├── screenshots/     # Screenshots of the lab process/results
 │    ├── code/            # Relevant scripts or configuration files used in the lab
 │    └── outputs/         # Any exported outputs or results
 ├── Lab-02_Name/
 │    ├── ...
 └── README.md             # General repository documentation
```
### Lab-Specific README File
Each lab folder will contain its own `README.md`, which will document:
- Lab Title
- Description of the lab
- AWS Services explored
- Steps/Implementation process
- Results

This will allow for detailed documentation and make each lab easy to navigate.
